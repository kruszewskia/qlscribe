Qt lightScribe Installaton instructions
=======================================

To compile qlscribe succesfully you may need additional packages installed. 

So for Ubuntu folowing packages are required:
    build-essential
    cmake
    libqt4-dev
    libdbus-1-dev

For 64 bit Ubuntu you need also to install folowing packages:
    ia32-libs
    libc6-dev-i386 (maverick only, see notes)
    g++-multilib

    (Note: this will work for maverick (10.10) version, for lucid and karmic 
     /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so.5 is missing in ia32-libs so you would have to 
     find it see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ia32-libs/+bug/431091 )
    (Note: On 64 bit if you get "undefined reference std::_Rb_tree_increment..." link error it is
     possible that link /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so points to /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so.5... change it
     so it points /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so.6...)

For 64 bit Ubuntu libdbus-1-dev does not have link for i386 libdbus-1.so you may need to create one manually:
     sudo ln -s libdbus-1.so.3 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libdbus-1.so
    

To compile and install, first download release from http://qlscribe.sourceforge.net/
or check out project from subversion repository for particular release:

     svn co https://qlscribe.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qlscribe/tags/release-N.M qlscribe

or if you want to test latest development version:

     svn co https://qlscribe.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qlscribe/trunk qlscribe

Then go to the source directory and type:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..

(If you want to install in a different path, use instead:
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path)
    make
    sudo make install

If cmake fails to find lightScribe API specify environment variable LIGHTSCRIBEDIR:

    LIGHTSCRIBEDIR=/opt/lightscribe cmake ..

Include files should be in ${LIGHTSCRIBEDIR}/include and lib in ${LIGHTSCRIBEDIR}/lib

You need manually install dbus config and service files. They are located in INSTALL_PATH/share/qlscribe
So on my ubuntu system I do 
    sudo cp /usr/local/share/qlscribe/lightscribe.conf /etc/dbus-1/system.d/ 
    sudo cp /usr/local/share/qlscribe/org.lightscribe.printManager.service /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/
    sudo /etc/init.d/dbus reload

Your system may have different path please refer dbus system daemon documentation

You need to download lightScribe SDK for qlscribe to build and lightScribe runtime
for qlscribe to run. For details see lightScribe webpage:

     http://www.lightscribe.org/

Enjoy!
