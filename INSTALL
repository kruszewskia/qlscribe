Qt lightScribe Installaton instructions
=======================================

To compile and install, first download release from http://qlscribe.sourceforge.net/
or check out project from subversion repository for particular release:

      svn co https://qlscribe.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qlscribe/tags/release-N.M qlscribe

or if you want to test latest development version:

      svn co https://qlscribe.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qlscribe/trunk qlscribe

Then go to the source directory and type:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..

(If you want to install in a different path, use instead:
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path)
  make
  sudo make install

If cmake fails to find lightScribe API specify environment variable LIGHTSCRIBEDIR:

  LIGHTSCRIBEDIR=/opt/lightscribe cmake ..

Include files should be in ${LIGHTSCRIBEDIR}/include and lib in ${LIGHTSCRIBEDIR}/lib

Once installed, you can start Qt lightScribe by typing "qlscribe", but due to API
requirement if you want to burn qlscribe has to be started by root as "sudo qlscribe"

You need to download lightScribe SDK for qlscribe to build and lightScribe runtime
for qlscribe to run. For details see lightScribe webpage:

     http://www.lightscribe.org/

Enjoy!
